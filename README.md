# Practice Calculator
This exercise creates a basic calculator that takes in two user inputs and then (1) adds them together, (2) subtracts one from another, (3) multiplies them together, or (4) divides one from another.
If the user enters something other than an integer, an appropriate error message is sent to the user.
